<details><summary>Content</summary>

- [X] Programming Paradigms
  <details>

    - Procedural Programming: Focuses on procedures or routines.
    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Focuses on objects that contain data and methods.

  </details>

- [X] Class diagrams
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Classes: Represented by rectangles with three compartments (name, attributes, methods).
    - Relationships:
        - Association: A "uses-a" relationship.
        - Aggregation: A "has-a" relationship, parts can exist independently.
        - Composition: A "contains-a" relationship, parts cannot exist independently.
  </details>

- [X] Abstraction
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
  </details>

- [X] Classes
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Blueprint for objects. Defines the data and behavior that objects can have.
  </details>

- [X] Objects
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Instance: A unique occurrence of a class. Has its own set of data and methods.
  </details>

- [X] Encapsulation
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
  </details>

- [X] Inheritance
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Mechanism where a new class (derived or child class) is created from an existing class (base or parent class).
  </details>

- [X] Polymorphism
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Ability of an object to take on many forms. Allows methods to be defined in multiple ways.
  </details>

- [X] ENUM
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Special class that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
  </details>

- [X] Interfaces
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Concept: Blueprint of a class. Specifies a set of methods that a class must implement.
  </details>

- [X] OOP Concepts
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Coupling: Degree of dependency between classes or modules.
    - Cohesion: Degree to which elements inside a module belong together.
    - Association: Relationship between classes where one class uses the functionalities of another.
    - Aggregation: "Has-a" relationship where one class contains references to another class.
    - Composition: "Contains-a" relationship where one class contains objects of another class.
  </details>

- [X] SOLID Principles
  <details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
    - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
    - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality.
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
